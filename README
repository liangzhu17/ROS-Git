The first project realizes a turtle2's circular motion around turtle1. The center turtle1's position is set to be (5,5). Turtle2's real-time position
is subscribed and printed out in the terminal. A launch file is ready for its start. 
Both subscriber and publisher are described in turtle_ws/src/communication/src/talker.cpp



The second project realizes an assumed robot to move to a position (2,2). Moving process percentage is shown in the terminal.
